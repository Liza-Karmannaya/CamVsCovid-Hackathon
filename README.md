# CamVsCovid-Hackathon
Code and materials for the CamVsCovid Hackathon (1st-4th May 2020)

This repository contains 2 scripts used in the creation of the VoiceBack platform (more info at www.feedbackpolicy.wordpress.com). 

This first script, cam-vs-covid.py, is used to autpomatically create WordClouds from open-text responses to the survey. The WordClouds visualise most frequently mentioned words in the responses. This script also contains code for more advanced analysis of text, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. This is a feature that may be implemented into our platform in the future. 

The second script, script.r, is used to create the RShiny app, which provides visual feedback aggregated by demographic group (the interactive app itself can be accessed here https://wereadminds.shinyapps.io/COVID-demo/).
